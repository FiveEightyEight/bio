            My journey into software development started with a small
            twistâ€”designing custom maps for Starcraft: Brood War, where I
            crafted complex conditions and actions. That early experience
            sparked my curiosity about how things work behind the scenes. Years
            later, I started learning Java during my off hours to build mobile
            apps for Android. Eventually, I found my way into a bootcamp in NYC,
            where I learned web development and fell in love with its
            versatility.

            My first role was at a HealthTech startup, where I contributed to
            making healthcare more accessible by helping to lower prescription
            drug costs. In my personal time I focus on honing my skills through
            personal side projects and exploring new challenges in both web and
            mobile development.
